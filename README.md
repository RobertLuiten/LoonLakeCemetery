# LoonLakeCemetery
A directory containing a list of all gravesites in Loon Lake Cemetery in Washington along with maps. I completed this for my Eagle Project my senior year of high school. I hope this helps keep the memory of the cemetery & the people in it alive.

-[CemeterySpreadsheet.xlsx](CemeterySpreadsheet.xlsx) contains a spreadsheet containing the names of all current gravesite in the cemetery (compiled from the cemetery's records & scouting out gravesites in the cemetery), their lot number (the location of which can be found in either of the [MainMap](MainMapColor.png) files), their date of birth and/or death, branch of military, and a link to their FindAGrave page, which was updated with all the information on this sheet.

-[FirstAdditionMap](FirstAdditionMap.jpg) & [CarlsonAdditionMap](CarlsonAdditionMap.jpg) both are maps of the different sections of the cemetery.

-[BothAdditionsMap](BothAdditionsMap.jpg) contains both.

-[MainMapBW](MainMapBW.png) & [MainMapColor](MainMapColor.png) both contain maps that I drew out to enhance the clarity of the gravesite locations, as well as aid the navigatability of the cemetery.
